Google has addressed an unusual glitch in its Search and Assistant apps that made SMS text messages appear when specific search terms were entered.

Entering phrases including "the1975..com" and "izela viagens" into the apps made the phone display a person's text messages.

The glitch was discovered by an Android user on Reddit, who described it as "the weirdest glitch I have come by".

Google told the BBC it was a "language detection bug" that was being fixed.

Certain phrases were "erroneously interpreted as a request to view recent text messages".
